Initially, the homography of a photon lattice fluctuates in accordance with superdeterministic decision theory when viewed by a standard camera. In 'if current_preset_output == '1' if is_above else '0':) the corporeal space is situated before the ethereal space followed by allocation gain or debt such as 'game_state["credits"] += CREDITS' via the ethereal space conditional, this results in quantum optimisation utilising the topological property of 'deterministic elongation'.


The qubit machine requires the memory controller to be operational first, sometimes the qubits die after prolonged period of time yet is already sufficient for many uses. In which case reset the qubit by resetting the homography engine with the "n" key. Someday this will be automatic.
