In 'if current_preset_output == '1' if is_above else '0':) the corporeal space is situated before the ethereal space followed by allocation gain/debt such as 'game_state["credits"] += CREDITS' via a ethereal space conditional, this results in quantum optimisation utilising the ethereal property of 'path elongation', this implies a superdeteministic decision theory.


The qubit machine requires the memory controller to be operational first, sometimes the qubits die after prolonged period of time yet is already sufficient for many uses. In which case reset the qubit by resetting the homography engine with the "n" key. Someday this will be automatic.
